Expectation about the Subject SIA

What you should expect I expect to learn useful ways to design systems, like how to figure out what the system needs, make architectural models, and pick the best integration strategies.

This topic should also include different ways to integrate, like APIs, middleware, and cloud-based solutions. More importantly

I want to get some hands-on experience with the tools and frameworks that professionals use in the field so that I can connect what I've learned in theory with how it works in practice.
