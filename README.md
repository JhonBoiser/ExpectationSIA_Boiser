Expectation about the Subject SIA

I think this course will help me know how tech works as one. A lot of places now use many apps, tools, & tech. I hope this class will show me how to link them with no fuss. I want to learn about how systems are set up, made, & kept up too. I aim to find out how pros mix systems. 

I plan to study how APIs, data banks, & apps that talk to each other work. I want to see how to make plans that work well & last. I also wish this class lets me try what I learn in real cases.

In the end, I hope this class will grow not just my tech skills, but also my smart thinking & problem fix skills. Mixing tech means to find the top ways to join tech. I think this class will push me to think wild & wise. By the close, I aim to feel sure to craft & start system builds that are smart, safe & can grow.
